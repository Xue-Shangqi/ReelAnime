This project is suppose to be an anime recommendation system, before the system can recommend you anything,
you have to add some anime into your like list. It will generate 3 similar anime for each corresponding anime 
in your like list. The recommendation ML algorithm is not the most accurate ML model, so some recommendations 
might be inaccurate. 

Thank you!
