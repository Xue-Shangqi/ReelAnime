This project recommends different anime based on what user's anime like list. The machine learning algorithm for used for recommendation is KNN. The algorithm basically takes different elements from liked anime and map them out to see other anime that are similar on a graph. For the frontend, I used streamlit to design everything. To connect to the database, I used psycopg. The database is actually hosted on supabase while the website is hosted on Streamlit Cloud.

This project is suppose to be an anime recommendation system, before the system can recommend you anything,
you have to add some anime into your like list. It will generate 3 similar anime for each corresponding anime 
in your like list. The recommendation ML algorithm is not the most accurate ML model, so some recommendations 
might be inaccurate. 

Thank you!
